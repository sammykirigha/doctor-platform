                The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is
                said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is
                composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less
                corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real
                Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible,
                but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin
                script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative
                meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract
                attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
                layout.
